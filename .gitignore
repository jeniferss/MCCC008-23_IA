# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version
app/**/.python-version

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
app/**/uv.lock

# Ignore any .venv directories under app/ at any depth
app/**/.venv/

# PyCharm
#   JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#   be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#   and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#   option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
.idea/

# Ruff stuff:
app/**/.ruff_cache/


# __pycache__ directories
**/__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*$py.class
